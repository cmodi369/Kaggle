# Kaggle
This repository includes my contribution in the kaggle community. It is completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

## Contents
- [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](Titanic_Survival_Prediction): Create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. It uses random forest for binary classification.
- [Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms](Binary_Prediction_of_Poisonous_Mushrooms): Predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

## Prerequisites
Install dependencies using pip (Refer [Environment through PIP](#environment-through-pip)). Alternatively, create environment using environment.yml with Anaconda (Refer [Environment through conda](#environment-through-conda)).

### Environment through PIP 
- **Download and Install Python:**

   Ensure you have the last Python version  installed. If not, download and install it from Python's official website. For detailed instructions, refer to the tutorials:

   - [How to Install Python on Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-windows/)
   - [How to Install Python on Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-linux/)
   - [How to Download and Install Python on macOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-python-latest-version-on-macos-mac-os-x/)

- **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
  
### Environment through Conda
- **If Anaconda is not installed, Download and Install Anaconda:**

   - [How to Install Anaconda on Windows?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-anaconda-on-windows/)
   - [How to Install Anaconda on Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-anaconda-on-linux/?ref=asr7)
   - [How to Install Anaconda on macOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-anaconda-on-macos/)

- **Create the Conda Environment:**
   Run the following command to create a new environment using the environment.yml file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
  This command will download and install all the dependencies specified in the environment.yml file.
